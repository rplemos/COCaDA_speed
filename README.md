# COCαDA - Large Scale Protein Interatomic Contact Optimization by Cα Distance Matrices

## Description

COCαDA (Contact Optimization by alpha-Carbon Distance Analysis) optimizes the calculation of atomic interactions in proteins, by using a set of fine-tuned Cα distances between every pair of aminoacid residues.
The code includes a customized parser for both PDB and CIF files, containing functionalities for handling large files, filtering out specific residues and interactions, and calculating geometric properties such as centroid and normal vectors for aromatic residues.

Additionaly, as comparison for demonstrating the efficiency of our method, a Biopython-dependent script is also included (in the folder Biopython), containing the same restrictions and contact definitions.

The contact types available are:
  - Hydrophobic
  - Hydrogen Bond
  - Attractive
  - Repulsive
  - Disulfide Bond
  - Salt Bridge
  - Aromatic Stacking

## Features

- **Fast Processing:** COCaDA averages 2.5x faster processing times against Fixed Cutoffs definitions, and 6x faster against Biopython's NeighborSearch.
- **PDB and CIF Parsing:** Supports parsing both PDB and CIF files to extract atomic and residue information.
- **Residue Filtering:** Ignores low-quality atoms, water molecules, and problematic/erroneous information.
- **Interaction Analysis:** Identifies contacts between specified types of atoms based on predefined conditions.
- **Aromatic Residue Analysis:** Computes centroids and normal vectors for aromatic residues, to determine aromatic stacking contacts.
- **Multi-Core Processing:** All analyzes can be run on any combination of cores on the user's computer.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- For both methods:
  - Python==3.x
  - NumPy==2.0.1
  - psutil==6.0.0 (for MultiCore usage)

- Exclusively for BioPython:
  - Biopython==1.84

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/LBS-UFMG/COCaDA.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd COCaDA
   ```

3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
## Usage
### To run COCaDA:

1. Ensure you are in the project directory and the virtual environment is activated (if used).

2. Run the script with the path to your folder or file:
    ```sh
    python3  main.py <-f> path_to_files/<.cif/.pdb> [-m] [-o] [-h]
    ```
**Parameters:**
 - <-f> <--files>: List of files in pdb/cif format (at least one required). Wildcards are accepted (ex. -f *.cif).
 - [-m] [--mode]: Use Multi-Core mode. Default uses all available cores, and selections can be defined based on the following: -m X = specific single core. -m X-Y = range of cores from X to Y. -m X,Y,Z... = specific multiple cores.
 - [-o] [--output]: Outputs the detailed results to files in ./outputs.
 - [-h] [--help]: Shows usage and instructions.
